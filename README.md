# Image Classifier

Artificially Intelligent Program that classifies Images of Flowers from 102 categories listed below with 76% accuracy.
I am using 'vgg16' and 'alexnet' pre-trained networks with customized classifier built on top

Categories of flower images in json format https://github.com/itsmpython/image_classifier/blob/master/cat_to_name.json

** The model uses Pytorch

## Features

1. Image Classifier Project.ipynb is a jupyter notebook that includes implementation details of this project
2. train.py includes program that can train 2 models 'Vgg16' and 'Alexnet' which have been used with custom classifier 
built on top
3. predict.py can predict the top K types of flower images.

## Installation instructions
1. Install the following python libraries
    matplotlib.pyplot  
    torch . 
    torchvision . 
    collections . 
    time . 
    from PIL import Image .
    numpy . 
    pandas . 
    seaborn . 
    json . 
    
2. Run train.py to train the model .
    Example : python train.py -d '~/flowers/' -a 'vgg16' -u 4096 1000 500 -l 0.001 -e 1 -g 'N'

3. Run predict.py to predict the name of an imag . 
    Example: python predict.py -i "~/flowers/test/10/image_07090.jpg" -p "/path/to/imag_classifier/checkpoint" -c "checkpoint.pth" -K 5 -a "vgg16" -g "N"
